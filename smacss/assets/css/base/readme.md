## BASE.CSS: 
should contain the config files that will be used for all website 

e.g: reset.css and/or normalize.css

- RESET.CSS: The goal of a reset stylesheet is to reduce browser
  inconsistencies in things like default line heights, margins and font sizes of headings, and so on.
   
- NORMALIZE.CSS - Makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
  It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.

Same purpose with slightly different implementation
